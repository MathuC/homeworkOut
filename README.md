# HomeworkOut

## Introduction
This project won a prize in the 2020 Code.Jam hackathon. [Devpost Page](https://devpost.com/software/homeworkout)

HomeworkOut guides you through cycles of 3 minute bodyweight workouts, 22 minute sessions of intense focus and 5 minute breaks. This project promotes wellness during the Covid-19 lockdown (libraries and gyms are closed as of November 2020 in Montreal), and helps you stay as productive as possible.

All the logos/images were made by me (Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Animate).

## Components

`index.php` is the homepage with the start button and eventually, the timer.

`add.php` contains the PHP script to add user's stats (workout & study time) into a MySQL database.

`get.php` contains the PHP scripts to get user's stats and display them on the homepage to encourage users to be more productive.

`about.html` is a page that briefly describes the project.

`style.css` has most of the CSS code for the HTML page.
